# js-game
#### A javascript puzzle game in which the player creates a sequence of moves used by the character to navigete through the map. The player starts with 3 lives, and loses one everytime he hits a wall. If the player runs out of lives or completes all maps, an overlay apperas allowing the user to start again. You can play the game [here](https://antheosad.github.io/js-game/ "here").
#### The map itself is a 2 dimensional array, the values of which represent the block type: 1 (Air), 2 (Wall), 3 (Spawn point), 4 (Exit)
#### By default the game tries to fetch maps.json file from this repository. If there is a problem loading the maps, the default three test maps will be loaded.
#### The game also has a level builder [level builder](https://antheosad.github.io/js-game/level-builder "level builder"), which you can use to crete custom maps. For now if you want to share and play the maps you have created, you will need to open the console inside the level builder and call the `Export()` function.
